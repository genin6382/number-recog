Hand Gesture Recognition and Finger Counting

ABSTRACT:

This Python script utilizes the MediaPipe library to perform hand detection and gesture recognition using a webcam feed. It detects the number of extended fingers in the detected hand and displays the count on the screen in real-time.

INTRODUCTION:

The ability to recognize hand gestures and count fingers has various applications in human-computer interaction, sign language recognition, and virtual reality. This project aims to provide a simple yet effective solution for real-time hand gesture recognition and finger counting using the MediaPipe library in Python.

KEYWORDS:

Hand Gesture Recognition, Finger Counting, MediaPipe, OpenCV, Python, Computer Vision, Real-time, Webcam.

METHODOLOGY:

The methodology involves loading a pre-trained hand detection model from MediaPipe and processing video frames captured from the webcam. The hand detection model detects hands in the video frames, and landmarks are drawn on the detected hands. The script then counts the number of extended fingers based on the landmark positions. The finger count is displayed on the screen along with the hand landmarks using OpenCV.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION:

The Python script demonstrates accurate hand detection, gesture recognition, and finger counting in real-time. By leveraging the MediaPipe library, the system achieves robust performance and can be used for various applications such as virtual reality interactions, educational purposes, and accessibility solutions.
